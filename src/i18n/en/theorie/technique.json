          "In the broad sense of the term, when used in a scientific context, the word artifact refers to an alteration in the result of an examination, observation, or measurement that is due to the technical process used (Larousse Dictionary). For example, one can imagine a thermometer stored at room temperature which, when placed in the medium whose temperature is to be measured, would heat up said medium and thus bias the reading taken. Another example of a scenario where artifacts are quite common: standard optical microscopes. As soon as an image is distorted by an impurity or imperfection on the lens, artifacts can be generated. For anyone performing scientific observation, it is therefore imperative to know the process by which measurements are taken in order to recognize the many potential pitfalls that may lie in their path.",
          "In ultrasound, the consequences of an unnoticed artifact can vary in severity depending on the case. Thus, it is essential to know how to recognize them, both to maintain optimal observation accuracy and to avoid generating false positives or false negatives."

            "Modifiable: this type of artifact can be encountered if the technique is inadequate, if the parameters are incorrect, or if the equipment is defective",
            "Non-modifiable: i.e., consequences of the intrinsic operating mode of ultrasonography. These cannot be avoided and do not result from an error or equipment defect. These are systematic artifacts that must be recognized and whose appearance (on the ultrasound image) must be interpreted differently from that, sometimes identical, of other structures that would not be subject to this type of artifact. These artifacts often result from the interaction of ultrasound with tissues adjacent to the tissue presenting the artifact (in the same axial or lateral plane)"

          "Anisotropy: When the ultrasound beam hits the anisotropic tissue (e.g., tendon or ligament) perpendicularly, the 'true' echogenicity is reflected. A beam angle as small as 5Â° (relative to the long axis of the tissue) can cause the disappearance of the normally expected hyperechoic appearance. This can wrongly suggest an abnormal structure of this tissue (since abnormal tendons/ligaments are frequently hypoechoic).",
          [
            "This phenomenon requires even greater attention when the targeted anisotropic tissues have curvilinear or sinuous paths (e.g., the distal portion of the supraspinatus tendon). Probe positioning then becomes critical and can represent a challenge for an inexperienced evaluator.",
            "As counter-intuitive as it may seem, anisotropy can also be useful for structure identification purposes. Indeed, it can help distinguish a ligament or tendon among a background of equally hypoechoic soft tissues whose apparent echogenicity is little/not altered by beam angle changes."

            "In the context of ultrasonography, if the ultrasound beam is too wide relative to a structure we are trying to observe, the resulting image comes to represent an average of the tissues surrounding this structure. We thus run the risk of 'losing' the shadow zone under the structure which, normally, would have contributed to identifying its presence."
