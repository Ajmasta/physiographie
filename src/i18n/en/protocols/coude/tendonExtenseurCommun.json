          "The common extensor tendon is a structure that serves as the proximal attachment point (origin) for several muscles of the lateral forearm. Among these muscles are four extensor muscles and one supinator muscle, all superficial: the extensor carpi radialis brevis [ECRB], extensor digitorum communis [EDC], extensor carpi ulnaris [ECU], extensor digiti minimi [EDM], and supinator. The ECRB, EDC, and ECU have truly fused proximal tendons, forming a common tendon, while the EDM and supinator have distinct tendons but insert at the same site as the ECRB, EDC, and ECU. The ECRB tendon, being the deepest, is adjacent to the humeral capitulum and glides on its surface during elbow flexion and extension movements. This is why the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis absolutely requires involvement of at least the ECRB tendon (see 'Clinical Relevance' section below)<a href='#ref14' class='reference'>[14]</a>.",
          "The muscles of the forearm are classified according to their belonging to the medial or lateral compartments, based on their anatomical location. As the muscular mass of the forearm can be anatomically complex, it is important to know the normal anatomy to be able to identify the structures visualized during ultrasonographic examination (adapted from Walz et al, 2010)."

          "The condition commonly known as tennis elbow consists of an involvement of the common extensor tendon at the lateral epicondyle (and not an involvement of the lateral epicondyle, as the name might suggest). It is an overuse condition caused by excessive traction at the osteotendinous attachment of the common extensor tendon<a href='#ref2' class='reference'>[2]</a>.",
          "As the nickname tennis elbow suggests, the practice of certain sports (including tennis) seems to be associated with the clinical picture. Indeed, this condition is frequently encountered in tennis players, due to powerful backhand strokes that generate considerable tension in the common extensor tendon. Nevertheless, this condition is encountered much more frequently in non-athletes.",
          "From a pathophysiological perspective, this condition can result from repetitive overuse (chronic microtrauma) in various professional or recreational activities. This leads to a degenerative process that can lead to partial or complete ruptures of the common extensor tendon or involvement of the bony insertion site (enthesitis)<a href='#ref2' class='reference'>[2]</a>.",
          "During physical examination, subjects with lateral epicondylitis present with pain on palpation of the lateral aspect of the elbow, which persists (although of lesser intensity) in the proximal region of the forearm. In subjects who have had this condition for several months (or more), there may be persistent pain at rest associated with decreased range of motion at the elbow and wrist<a href='#ref2' class='reference'>[2]</a>.",
          "Typically, the diagnosis can be made solely based on a conclusive physical examination, but ultrasound imaging can be used in the presence of a refractory or complex case.",
          "According to an expert consensus from the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, ultrasound imaging is recognized as a first-choice imaging modality for examining structures involved in lateral epicondylitis (grade 3/3 consensus). Moreover, the level of evidence (grade 'A') indicates that the literature contains several unanimous randomized clinical trials and cohort studies on the subject<a href='#ref6' class='reference'>[6]</a>."
