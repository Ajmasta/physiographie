          "The median nerve [MN] is a mixed nerve (i.e., sensory and motor) that is especially well-known to the public as it is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome (see Clinical Relevance section). It is sometimes called the 'nerve of prehension' because it innervates many muscles responsible for flexion of the hand, fingers, and thumb. The MN receives afferents from the entire brachial plexus (roots C5 to T1) and is formed from portions of the lateral and medial cords<a href='#ref3' class='reference'>[3]</a>.",
          "From the brachial plexus, the MN progresses distally along the lateral intermuscular septum, under the short head of the biceps brachii and lateral to the brachial artery. At mid-arm, the MN then passes to the medial aspect of the arm to join the ulnar fossa, where it is then the most medial structure, except for the common proximal tendon of the pronators and flexors. The MN progresses distally, medial to the elbow, under the flexor digitorum superficialis [FDS] and above the flexor digitorum profundus [FDP]. Once at the distal third of the forearm, the MN continues its course superficial to the FDS, medial to the flexor carpi radialis and lateral to the palmaris longus, before entering the carpal tunnel. It is only distal to the elbow that the median nerve begins to be directly involved in the transmission of sensory and motor nerve impulses<a href='#ref8' class='reference'>[8]</a>.",
          "The proximal limit of the carpal tunnel corresponds to the wrist flexion crease, while the distal limit is at the level of the base of the third metacarpal bone. To better visualize their relative positions, the structures delimiting the carpal tunnel can be compared to the floor, ceiling, and walls of a room<a href='#ref8' class='reference'>[8]</a>:",

          "Ten structures pass through the carpal tunnel, including 9 tendons (4 tendons of the FDS, 4 tendons of the FDP, and the flexor pollicis longus tendon) and the median nerve. It is within the carpal tunnel that the MN separates into three terminal branches, which innervate<a href='#ref8' class='reference'>[8]</a>:",

          "At its entry into the carpal tunnel, the MN typically exhibits an oval profile, while it becomes progressively flattened as it progresses distally. The carpal ligament, which delimits the 'ceiling' of the tunnel (see above), is a thick fascia that extends from the trapezium and scaphoid tubercle (radially) to the pisiform and hook of hamate (ulnarly)<a href='#ref1' class='reference'>[1]</a>.",
          "The anatomy of the peripheral nerves of the upper limb has been the subject of numerous studies over the last century. For example, in 1945, Sunderland was already describing the fascicular organization of the median nerve<a href='#ref15' class='reference'>[15]</a>. This organization has since been the subject of several studies confirming the arrangement of sensory and motor fibers that corresponds to the location (radial vs. ulnar) of the innervated structures. The attached diagram, adapted from a 2015 study, illustrates the arrangement of each of these fibers."
