          "Unlike the skin covering the dorsal region of the foot, the skin covering the plantar surface is thick, with an epidermis approximately eight times thicker than that of the dorsal surface <a href='#ref1' class='reference'>[1]</a>. At the posterior aspect, the skin covers a very thick subcutaneous tissue (plantar fat pad, average thickness of 18 mm) whose most obvious role is the absorption of impacts inherent to locomotion. Additionally, it has a recognized function as a static and dynamic stabilizer of the longitudinal arch <a href='#ref6' class='reference'>[6]</a>.",
          "The plantar fascia is a fibrous connective tissue that can be divided into three sections (or 'cords'): central, lateral, and medial. The central portion, which is our focus, connects the calcaneus (medial tubercle) to the metatarsophalangeal joints (separating into 5 bands at the midtarsal level), and can be directly observed through ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. This portion of the plantar fascia has a triangular shape (wide posteriorly, narrow anteriorly) and stands out as being the thickest, widest, and strongest of the three cords.",
          "From a functional and clinical perspective, the correlation between the plantar fascia and the triceps surae (gastrocnemius and soleus) is well established, but the anatomical foundations of this correlation were not/little known until recently. A study published in 2013 <a href='#ref8' class='reference'>[8]</a> established that the plantar fascia is connected to the paratenon of the Achilles tendon (not the tendon itself) through the calcaneal periosteum. This supports the idea that the triceps surae tends to be involved in pathologies involving the plantar fascia. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that the lateral and medial portions of the plantar fascia could be a source of proprioceptive afferents involved in motor coordination, which is of particular interest in a rehabilitation context.",
          "From a clinical physiotherapy perspective, the interest in the plantar fascia can be explained in part by its structure's tendency to change with certain mechanical stresses. These structural modifications can affect, for example, the thickness or stiffness of the plantar fascia <a href='#ref11' class='reference'>[11]</a> [See 'Clinical Relevance' section]. Also, as is the case for many other joints, plantar fascia ultrasound can be used for injection guidance, to avoid injection into the plantar fat pad, which would result in adipose tissue atrophy (and incidentally reduces the number of injections needed) <a href='#ref9' class='reference'>[9]</a>."

          "From a metrological quality perspective, ultrasound is comparable in several aspects (reliability, validity) to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thus represents a very interesting option for clinicians given its high accessibility. Moreover, when compared to conventional radiography and MRI, ultrasound imaging is less expensive, faster, simpler to use, less invasive, and radiation-free.",
          "Finally, the difference in plantar fascia thickness (healthy population vs. with plantar fasciitis) was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.0005), indicating that this data can be considered clinically significant<a href='#ref10' class='reference'>[10]</a>."
