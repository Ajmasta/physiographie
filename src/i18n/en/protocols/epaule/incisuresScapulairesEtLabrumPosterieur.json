          "The suprascapular notch, marked in blue in the adjacent animation, is a relief of the scapula located at its lateral superior border, just adjacent to the coracoid process <a href='#ref2' class='reference'>[2]</a>.",
          "This notch is transformed into an osteofibrous canal by the presence of the transverse scapular ligament, analogous to the relationship between the bicipital groove and the transverse humeral ligament. Within this canal, or foramen, passes the suprascapular nerve, which provides motor innervation to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles in addition to participating in the sensory innervation of several other muscles and ligaments in the rotator cuff region <a href='#ref2' class='reference'>[2]</a>. The literature attributes part of its importance to this site due to a related pathology: suprascapular nerve entrapment neuropathy. Sometimes traumatic, this pathology is mainly characterized by significant loss of strength and severe pain in the rotator cuff region. Suprascapular nerve entrapment can occur either within the suprascapular foramen or at the level of the greater scapular notch (also called spinoglenoid notch), marked in red in the adjacent animation. The spinoglenoid notch is located at the lateral end of the scapular spine and somewhat connects the infraspinous and supraspinous fossae.",
          "There is documented anatomical variability for the suprascapular notch (and, incidentally, for the transverse scapular ligament) which, according to some authors <a href='#ref3' class='reference'>[3]</a><a href='#ref4' class='reference'>[4]</a>, could explain the apparent predisposition of certain individuals to develop this type of problem. It is also noted that athletes practicing overhead impact sports (volleyball, basketball) seem to be more prone to this type of condition.",
          "The glenoid labrum is a fibrocartilaginous structure whose accessibility in ultrasonography varies depending on the approach used. During the evaluation of the suprascapular notch and adjacent structures, it is generally quite simple to visualize the posterior labrum, which caps the bony rim of the glenoid <a href='#ref1' class='reference'>[1]</a>. Indeed, the posterior labrum is more superficial, as is the inferior labrum, which is also accessible. In contrast, the anterior portion of the glenoid labrum is the deepest, and ultrasonographic observation of the superior portion is particularly difficult due to acoustic shadowing caused by the overlying acromion<a href='#ref1' class='reference'>[1]</a>."
