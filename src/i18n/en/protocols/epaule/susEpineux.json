          "The supraspinatus muscle is a small muscle located on the posterosuperior aspect of the shoulder. It is one of the four muscles composing the rotator cuff, along with the subscapularis (anterior aspect), infraspinatus and teres minor (both on the posterior aspect). The supraspinatus originates from the supraspinous fossa, whose name refers to the spine of the scapula, located inferiorly (caudal) to this site. The superior surface of the humeral greater tuberosity receives the distal insertion of this muscle. The supraspinatus has only one muscle belly and has an origin-insertion axis (when in anatomical position) oriented from inside to outside, back to front, and slightly top to bottom. Thus, this muscle has an action of external rotation (especially) and abduction of the glenohumeral joint.",
          "A good understanding of muscle orientation is imperative, especially when performing an ultrasonographic examination. To visualize the course of the supraspinatus tendon, one can start with the intra-articular portion of the long biceps. Indeed, these two tendons are parallel (only at this location) and the long biceps tendon has an echotexture and echogenicity that make it an easily recognizable reference point.",
          "When examined with the shoulder in resting position, only the distal portion of the supraspinatus tendon is accessible <a href='#ref1' class='reference'>[1]</a>, the difference being masked by the acromioclavicular arch and the humeral head. During an ultrasonographic evaluation, the patient is often asked to adopt a position that will make the supraspinatus more anterior, providing access to its entire tendon and its musculotendinous junction.",
          "At its distal third, the infraspinatus muscle passes through the subacromial space, just before the distal musculotendinous junction. The subacromial space is an entity mainly delimited by the coracoacromial arch and the humeral head. This space contains, among others, the rotator cuff tendons, the long biceps, and the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa<a href='#ref1' class='reference'>[1]</a>. The volume of this space varies from one individual to another due to several factors, including:",

          "This anatomical variability is often subject to a classification that recognizes 3 types of acromion, namely: flat (type I, 4.7% of the population); curved (type II, 51.76% of the population) and hooked (type III, 43.52% of the population). There is also an interesting correlation between acromion morphology (defined according to the above-mentioned classification) and the incidence of complete rotator cuff tears, which was studied on 140 shoulders in a study by Bigliani et al<a href='#ref4' class='reference'>[4]</a>, summarized in the table 1 below.",
