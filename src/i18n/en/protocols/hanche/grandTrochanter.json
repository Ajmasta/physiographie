These facets primarily serve as insertion sites for two hip abductor muscles, namely the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius.

However, the scientific literature regarding the usefulness of ultrasound in trochanteric pain syndrome currently relies mainly on lower quality articles (e.g., case studies), which explains why ultrasound is currently little used in this type of condition<a href='#ref11' class='reference'>[11]</a>."
