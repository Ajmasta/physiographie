Given that this is a space rather than a 'palpable' structure, we will discuss the structures that traverse and border the popliteal fossa. According to Bianchi and Martinoli<a href='#ref2' class='reference'>[2]</a>, the margins of the popliteal fossa are those listed above, namely the tendons of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and the two bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle.",

Additionally, between the semimembranosus tendon and the medial head of the gastrocnemius lies the semimembranosus bursa, which normally does not appear during ultrasound examination of a healthy subject. One can also observe the medial femoral condyle and its articular cartilage, which are normally easily identifiable.",

The two heads of the biceps femoris join into a common tendon in the cranial portion of the popliteal fossa, which extends to the fibular head. Since the common fibular nerve has a small diameter (and an oblique course), it is preferable to observe it in transverse view during examination.",

The most common complication is cyst rupture, which tends to cause diffuse and painful edema as well as great sensitivity to palpation.

They are significantly more prevalent in men (M:F ratio of 10:1 to 30:1) during their sixth to seventh decade.",
          "Unfortunately, they often go unnoticed during physical examination, and it is therefore important to know the two main risk factors: the presence of severe atherosclerotic disease and a history of abdominal aneurysms. In 50% to 70% of cases, popliteal aneurysms are bilateral, and among subjects with a popliteal aneurysm, 30% to 50% also have an abdominal aneurysm.",
          "The increase in volume occupied by the popliteal artery can lead to compression of the popliteal vein, which exposes to risks of edema and especially deep vein thrombosis [DVT]. The increased risk of DVT is not correlated with the severity (or dimensions) of the aneurysm, and 'small' aneurysms should therefore not be taken lightly.",
